# Grading System

## Goals

I want you to do the work. Primarily because I don't think you can learn this without doing it. And I think if you're still here after last semester then you _want_ to learn this.

For each assignment I'll include a rubric that defines what your expectations are. It has to be submitted for you to get credit. For things that are defined as criteria if you complete them all you'll get a 95 (A).

If a criteria isn't met then I'll make notations in the improvement column. When you do awesome stuff I'll put it in the embelisments column.

You always start with a 95 and then I'll subtract off from there based on needed improvements.

**You can submit the same assignment over and over**

So the point of the improvments is for me to tell you what changes to make to get to meet the missing criteria.

Final grade will be average of all work. 

Range for D- is 1 - 60 so you are better off turning in *something* than nothing.

### Example

Build a program that starts witha ball in the center of the screen and moves in the direction of the player's mouse

|   Improvements    |   Criteria    |   Embelisments    |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| | Assignment not submitted on time -10 points | |
| | Program compiles and runs | |
| | One class per file | |
| | Ball bounces at correct angle and detects edges | |
| | Quickly shaking mouse back and forth does not crash the program | |
| 0 - 80 points | 80 - 95 points | 95 - 100 points |

#### 1st submission

So if Mickey turns in a program that doesn't compile or run when the assignment is due

|   Improvements    |   Criteria    |   Embelisments    |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| | ~~Assignment not submitted on time -10 points~~ | |
| Fix compiler errors (2 x 5pts) | Program compiles and runs | |
|  Ball class should be in Ball.java  (1 x 2pts) | One class per file | |
| | Ball bounces at correct angle and detects edges | |
| | Quickly shaking mouse back and forth does not crash the program | |
| 0 - 80 points | 80 - 95 points | 95 - 100 points |

Score: 68 *(80 - 10 - 2)*

#### 2nd Submission

Then Mickey fixes the compiler errors and moves *Ball* into its own file and submits again

|   Improvements    |   Criteria    |   Embelisments    |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| | ~~Assignment not submitted on time -10 points~~ | |
| | _Program compiles and runs_ | |
| | _One class per file_ | |
| | Ball bounces at correct angle and detects edges **-5 does not detect top edge after 3 bounces** | |
| | _Quickly shaking mouse back and forth does not crash the program_ | |
| 0 - 80 points | 80 - 95 points | 95 - 100 points |

Score: 90 *(95 - 5)*

#### 3rd Submission

|   Improvements    |   Criteria    |   Embelisments    |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| | ~~Assignment not submitted on time -10 points~~ | |
| | _Program compiles and runs_ | |
| | _One class per file_ | |
| | _Ball bounces at correct angle and detects edges_  | Included accelleration & deceleration **+10** |
| | _Quickly shaking mouse back and forth does not crash the program_ | |
| 0 - 80 points | 80 - 95 points | 95 - 100 points |

Score: 105 *(95 + 10)*

The grade that gets entered for Mickey is 105, even if it takes all semester.

Notice though that if Mickey had not turned _anything_ in on the assignment due date there would have been a 10 point penalty that never went away.

So...get something done, then make it good.

The points added / deducted for various things are somewhat arbitrary, however you're not stuck with them (because you can resubmit) and I'm always willing to discuss.
